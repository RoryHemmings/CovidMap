# More Information
## Inspiration
We wanted to help our community persevere through the economic collapse caused instigated by the world's concerns of catching this virus, thus we created a website that informs people throughout the USA of the restrictive measures they should be taking and the level of caution they should pursue.

## What it does
This interactive US map provides information on every county's demographics, the impact COVID-19 has on the county, as well as a live rating of the severity of the situation. Specifically, our website compiles the following data for each county in the nation:
  * population
  * the number of infections
  * the proportion of infections (infections/population)
  * the number of fatalities
  * the projected number of fatalities (at least: infections * derivative-of-infections * 1 year)
  * social distancing measures advice (different for each county)
  * a unique set of ratings given by residents of the area

## How we built it
We used html, css, js, leaflet.js, mapbox, openstreetmap and usadata to produce this webpage.

## Our main files
Server.js        Manages the database
App.js            Client-side processing
Index.html     Visualizes Information
styles.css      Makes everything look nice

## Challenges we ran into
We struggled to find any APIs that provided live data of the virus in each county.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We LOVE how it looks & we are PROUD that it works ;)

## What we learned
We learned how to program an interactive map for web development and we furthered our understanding of databases.
